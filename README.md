One of my first projects I created. I went back and quickly added bootstrap and some styling, and fixed the layout, to not make it look like so bad. Previously it looked like I coded it with a potato. Now it looks like I coded it with a fench fry, which is a crispier tastier potato.   

Just CSS and HTML
