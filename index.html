            Solid Snake, real name David, also known as Old Snake, and briefly known as Iroquois Pliskin, or simply
            Snake, was a former spy, special operations soldier, and mercenary. He was a product of the Les Enfants
            Terribles project and therefore one of the clones of legendary soldier Big Boss, along with his clone
            brothers Liquid Snake and Solidus Snake. He was the killer of Big Boss' body double, Venom Snake.</p>
          <p class="lead">
            Possessing an IQ of 180 and being fluent in six languages,[4][6] he was known as "the man who makes the
            impossible possible" and his exploits made him into a living legend among the military black ops. Initially
            a Green Beret, Snake was later inducted into High-Tech Special Forces Unit FOXHOUND in the mid 1990s while
            it was under the leadership of Big Boss. Repeatedly tasked with disarming and destroying the latest
            incarnation of Metal Gear, a bipedal nuclear weapon-armed tank, Snake would thrice avert potential nuclear
            catastrophe, becoming a famed war hero.

          <p class="lead">Liquid Snake, real name Eli, also known as White Mamba (Kikongo: "Nyoka ya Mpembe"),
            McDonell/Master Miller, or simply Liquid, was the leader of FOXHOUND during the Shadow Moses Incident. He
            was cloned from Big Boss's DNA as part of the Les Enfants Terribles project, along with his brothers Solid
            Snake and Solidus Snake. Liquid was led to believe that he had been created in order to express Big Boss's
            recessive genetic traits, and as such, was "inferior" to Solid Snake who supposedly had received Big Boss's
            dominant genes. Liquid therefore held a strong resentment towards Solid and wished to defeat him in combat,
            reclaiming what he felt was his birthright, and thus proving his superiority.</p>

          <p class="lead">Raiden, real name Jack, also known as Jack the Ripper, White Devil, and Snake, was a
            Liberian-American mercenary and former special forces soldier. Previously a child soldier under Solidus
            Snake, Raiden was later selected by the Patriots to test the S3 Plan at the Big Shell, as a new recruit to
            the reformed FOXHOUND unit. He later worked alongside the Paradise Lost Army in their anti-Patriot
            activities, but was captured and forced to undergo heavy cybernetic experimentation. After successfully
            escaping, Raiden went on to assist Solid Snake during the Guns of the Patriots Incident.</p>
